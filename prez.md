# Applied ML @ LotikLabs

Sayre Blades 

Note:
There will be some physics in this talk, so I hope you are ready.

## Data Wrangling

1. Collection
1. Modifying
1. Analysis & Clensing
1. Automation

Note:

(data science's less attractive sibling)

I am not a data science expert. Most of my career has mostly been
focused on data processing: moving data from one place to another;
storing it; retrieving it; building pipelines around it; and
productionizing it.

In data-science terms, its called pre-processing.

----------------------------

## 1. Data Collection

v---------------------------

### First Attempt

Note:

When I first joined the team, this is what data collection
looked like.  This is data to train/validate/test a
classification model.

### Second Attempt

(code name: second attempt)
